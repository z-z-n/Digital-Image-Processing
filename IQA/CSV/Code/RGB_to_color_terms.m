% Returns the 11 basic color term vector given an RGB vector based on the paper: 
%  Learning Color Names for Real-World Applications
%  J. van de Weijer, Cordelia Schmid, Jakob Verbeek, Diane Larlus
%  TIP 2009
%
% Output:
%  color_terms - The 11-dimensional vector of the basic color terms.
%                The order of the color names is:
%                 black [0 0 0], blue [0 0 255], brown [128 102 64], grey [128 128 128], green [0 255 0], 
%                 orange [255 204 0], pink [255 128 255], purple [255 0 255], red [255 0 0], 
%                 white [255 255 255], yellow [255 255 0]
%
% Required Input:
%  RGB - The 3-dimensional vector of the RGB values of the color. Should be in the range [0,255]
