FAQ:

1) Why dual mesh (DM) structure is needed?
There are two reasons. First, these four sets guarantee the convergence. Second, 
we can use the updated neighbors for current position. Therefore, it is more computational efficient.

2) What is the difference between these three filters?
In general, GC filter is better in preserving details, compared with the other two. And
TV filter is better in removing noise as well as details. MC filter is between these two.

These three filters are correspond to three types of variational models. User should decide
which prior is to be assumed about the ground truth. 

3) What is the difference between split and nosplit scheme?
In general, splitting the image into four sets and looping on them is computational faster.
However, in some cases like deconvolution, we need to merge the four sets after every iteration.
So, it is better do nosplit scheme.

These two lead to exactly the same result. The split code is just more cache friendly.
